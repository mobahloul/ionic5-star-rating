# Ionic 5 Star Rating

This library was forked from https://github.com/melwinVincent/ionic5-star-rating for a test of Ionic 6.

## Install

Run `npm install --save https://github.com/mobahloul/ionic5-star-rating.git`

## How to use

Basically, same as https://github.com/melwinVincent/ionic5-star-rating/blob/master/README.md

But, there are two changes. 

First, Use this selector `ionic5-star-rating` in HTML template.

Second, the event of ionic4-star-rating was removed because the Events was deprecated in Ionic 5. So you can't subscribe it anymore.
